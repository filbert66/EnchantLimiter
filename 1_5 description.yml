1.5.3: New features, bug fixes
* //Fixed//: Hotbar duplication bugs in Anvil [[/bukkit-plugins/ench-limiter/tickets/3-duplicate-item-in-anvil/|Ticket 3]].
* //Added//: 
** **Apply_on_global_check**: new config node that allows referring to Disallowed anvil and/or table lists during item spawn, player pickup, or player hold events, respectively controlled by **Fix spawned items**, **Stop pickup**, **Fix held items**
*** three subsidiary items control these
*** **Apply_on_global_check.anvil**: if true, then **Disallowed anvil enchants** will also be checked during those events. Default is //false//
*** **Apply_on_global_check.table**: if true, then **Disallowed table enchants** will also be checked during those events. Default is //false//
*** both of above can be true, if desired.
*** **Apply_on_global_check.restrictive**: if true, the //highest// possible level will be used in case of conflict between **Disalllowed enhants** and the others. If false, the //lowest// enchant level will be used. Default is //true//.
** New feature to control armor use during equippage
*** if **Fix held items** is //true//, "fix" illegal armor as it is equipped normally.
*** if false, equip event will be cancelled with **Message on cancel hold** to player
*** also applies when user equips/receives armor from a dispenser (must be immediately in front of it)
** Related new feature, if **Fix held items** is //false//, to cancel using an illegal item when held
*** works for weapons, tools, and armor. Latter cancels right-click to equip armor
*** new permission **enchlimiter.useillegal** if true, overrides this effect. 
**** default is //Op// only.
*** Note: there is a Bukkit bug that can lose the "hold event" sometimes, so the new default value is //true//; otherwise, user can spam the button until they are able to use the illegal item.
** New **Downgrade in anvil**, if true, allows using illegal items in anvil by downgrading the result
*** if detected when placing an item, warnings will be posted to user with new "Warn" messages
*** if detected when taking result, action will be permitted but result will be downgraded 
*** Default is //false//.
*** If //false//, **Stop repairs** still applies.
** New command options for **el set**
*** Added new option to **set message**
**** **message hold** //true// enables **Message on cancel hold**
*** new **set global** options with three possibilities:
**** set global **table** true|false will set **Apply_on_global_check.table**
**** set global **anvil** true|false will set **Apply_on_global_check.anvil**
**** set global **restrictive** true|false will set **Apply_on_global_check.restrictive**
* //Changed//:
** New default for **Fix held items** is //true//; see above Note.
** Removed **Downgrade repairs** in favor of new **Downgrade in anvil**
*** Command el set **downgrade on** now sets **Downgrade in anvil**.
